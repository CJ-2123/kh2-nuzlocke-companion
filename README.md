# kh2-nuzlocke-companion

**Win con:** Complete every world in battle level order and beat Final Fights

**Nuzlocke Rules:**
1. Can only open one chest per room
	- room is defined as between loading zones
2. If Sora dies, the keyblade he has equipped is "dead" and cannot be used again. When all of his keyblades are "dead", the run is over. 
	- death is defined as Sora in his floating death animation (using mickey is technically dead because he's in that pose in the arena). 

**Additional rules:**
- Played on Level 1
- Keyblades on forms cannot be removed from their forms
	- if Sora dies, only his main keyblade is "dead"
- Worlds cannot be entered out of order
- Hundred Acre Wood (and Atlantica i guess) can be entered at any time

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Included in this companion mod: 
- 99 Power, Magic, and Defense boosts
- Fire, Blizzard, and Thunder in the GoA chests for Agrabah 2 completion

Fire, Blizzard, and Thunder are from left to right in the GoA. Grab the missing magic needed after completing OC2 and before starting AG2. 

Below is the list of worlds in battle level order with expected Strength, Magic, and Defense stats according to the vanilla game. Use the boosts to match their expected stats (similar to using rare candies to reach the level caps in Pokémon nuzlockes).  

(CoR 2nd fight, Transport to Remembrance, Sephiroth included as bonuses)
